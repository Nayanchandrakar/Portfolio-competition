Besides, I&apos;ve also committed my time to 1 companies full-time to help them hire and manage their own technical team, and I am here today to become a part of your journey.<br /><br />Recently, I have developed a platfrom that is an digital marketing platform: The Run Digital, where we help entrepreneurs fix their web goals and help them achieve them with our web-based solutions. We are, after all, KPI-driven.</p>
