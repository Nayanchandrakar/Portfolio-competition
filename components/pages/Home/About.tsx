Even if it sounds humorous, I went to Madrasa and returned as a programmer! âœŒ<br /><br />I consider myself to be completely blessed as I get to inspect and build websites for a living. Of my intense interest in the Web Platform &amp; SaaS products, I plan to build results-driven digital products for my clients while becoming part of meaningful businesses along the way.<br /><br />I&apos;ve built numerous websites and worked closely with the founders of the companies. Besides, I&apos;ve also committed my time to 3 companies part-time to help them hire and manage their own technical team, and I am here today to become a part of your journey.<br /><br />Recently, I&apos;ve co-founded an eCommerce Development Company: The Run Digital, where we help entrepreneurs fix their web goals and help them achieve them with our web-based solutions. We are, after all, KPI-driven.</p>
